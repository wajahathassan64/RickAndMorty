# Rick and Morty iOS App
# Overview
This iOS application was built as part of a take-home test, designed to interact with the Rick and Morty API. It fetches a list of characters and displays them in a paginated list. The app demonstrates clean code practices, modular architecture, and scalability, aligning with the concept of a "Super App," where different teams own and manage various features or mini-apps independently.
